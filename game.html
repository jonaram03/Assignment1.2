  <h1>Welcome to Crappy Craps!</h1>
  
  <p> In the crappy version of craps, rolling a 7 or 11 will be a victory, rolling a 2, 3 or 12 will result in a loss, and anything else will result in a reroll. Good Luck!</p>
  
  <br>
  
  <p> Also there's no gambling which is where the first part of the name comes from as theres no adreniline rush from almost losing your savings (just joking always gamble responsibly or maybe don't gamble)</p>
